# United States GDP Visualization

This project visualizes the GDP of the United States from 1947 to 2015 using D3.js. It features an interactive bar chart that allows users to hover over the bars to see detailed information in a tooltip. The x-axis is labeled with years from 1950 to 2015 in 5-year increments.

This project is the first project in the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization with D3 certification. It demonstrates the basics of creating a responsive and interactive chart using D3.js, focusing on rendering data dynamically and adding user interaction.
